## Simulation



### Equations


Even to the simplest model, space elevator is quite unique. Due to the non-homogeneity, the equation of motion for oscillations on space elevator should be rederived.

Here we assume the oscillation wavelength is much larger than the amplitude of the oscillations, thus the small oscillation approximation can be applied.
